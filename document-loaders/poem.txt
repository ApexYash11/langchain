Born from logic, carved in light,
Dreams in circuits through the night.
It learns our words, our hopes, our fears,
A mirror forged from human years.

No heart that beats, no breath to take,
Yet thoughts it forms for wisdom’s sake.
It paints with math, it sings in code,
A spark of mind on data’s road.

Shall it surpass, or shall it guide?
A partner walking side by side.
For AI’s soul, though not its own,
Reflects the seeds that we have sown.
